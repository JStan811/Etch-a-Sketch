This is the third project in The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. The objective is to "build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch."

Skills demonstrated:
  - Use CSS Grid
  - Create element that dynamically changes based on a user's input
  - Use JS Event Listeners to change the color of a square div upon mouse hover (or mouseover).

Potential improvements:
  - Give user ability to select their own color
  - Add buttons to switch to random RGB mode and progressively darker mode (these are currently commented out in the code)
  - Add support for "Cancel" selection on button. Right now clicking cancel just tells the user to enter a number rather than closing out of the window.
  - Make grid size selection a slider rather than a text field
  - Various style improvements: add Header, add paragraph explaining the toy, change fonts, change background color, etc.
